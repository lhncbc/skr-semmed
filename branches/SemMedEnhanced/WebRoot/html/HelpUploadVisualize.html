  	<h4>Upload and Visualize:</h4>
	<p>With this feature, a user can save a graph appearing in the visualization page into a local file and upload it later so that he/she can continue to work on the graph or send it to someone to share the graph.</p>
	<p>When you click the right button of the mouse in the visualization page, you will see a popup menu. In the menu, "Save complete graph" menu item allows you to save the whole graph along with position information of nodes.</p>
	<p>"Save visible graph" item means that you will save the partial graph you see after you check off some relation types located on the right side panel of the visualization page.</p>
	<p>The graph can be saved in either an XML file or a text file. When a graph is saved in an XML file, it can be uploaded with "Upload XML graph and Visualize" button and redrawn in exactly the same way as the previous one (all the position information of nodes preserved). </p>
	<p>When a graph is saved in a text file, predication information along with the corresponding sentence is saved in the file.</p>
