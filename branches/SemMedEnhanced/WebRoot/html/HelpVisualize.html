  		<h3>Visualize:</h3>
  	<p>When the button "Visualize" is clicked, a graph is shown in the visualization page. </p>
<p>The graph contains the predications of the summary. Nodes represent arguments, and arcs represent relations. The central concept of the summary appears as a node with text in red. Nodes are colored-coded into 15 high-level groups representing biomedical categories such as Chemicals and Drugs and Disorders (Figure 1).
	<p>
	<table>
	<tr><td><img src="/SemMed/img/SM_colors.gif" border="1" alt="High-Level Groups for Concepts"/></td></tr>
	<tr><td align="center">Figure 1. High-Level Groups for Concepts</td></tr>
	</table>
	<p>Right click on a node to display active links to other National Library of Medicine resources, such as the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, Entrez Gene, OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), and  GHR (Genetics Home Reference).  To use these links, allow pop-ups in your Web browser.  Links are unavailable if grayed out. Clicking on a node also causes information about it to appear in the Information Panel (see below).
	<p>The arcs representing relations between arguments are color-coded to indicate the name of the relation (see Relations Part below).
	The direction towards which the arc points indicates the direction of the relation between the two arguments.
